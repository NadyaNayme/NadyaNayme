### The Name. Nadya Nayme.

Nadya Nayme is an anonymous psuedonym that is a name-like variant of "Not a Name". It became my primary nickname after I couldn't use the name "Anonymous" when commenting on [css-tricks][3]. I've gone by many other psuedonyms but they mostly have been lost to time or scrubbed from the internet and replaced. Much of my online presence was around the Runescape community where I was known as "Nyu", which is my username in-game. However "Nyu" is very difficult to get as a username so I have been using "NadyaN" and eventually  the more complete "NadyaNayme" since around 2012-2013.

### About

I am a 90's kid at heart that firmly believes that sharing personally identifying information should be avoided. It is bizarre to me that, seemingly overnight in the early 2010s, it became completely normal to share everything about yourself on The Internet. Although I've been programming for nearly two decades if you look at the quality of my code it looks more like two weeks at most. I hack things together until it works and when it inevitably breaks I burn it to the ground and start again from scratch. I call this terrible approach "write-only programming". I pay nearly $75 a year for a vanity URL for my file uploads at [kimiga.aishitei.ru][1] and I use a Neocities to host my [personal website][2] which I have historically updated very sparingly but where you can read more about me and my interests. But who would want to do that?
