### About

Nadya Nayme is an anonymous psuedonym that is a name-like variant of "Not a Name". It became my primary nickname after I couldn't use the name "Anonymous" when commenting on [css-tricks][3]. I am a 90's kid at heart that firmly believes that sharing personally identifying information should be avoided. It is bizarre to me that, seemingly overnight in the early 2010s, it became completely normal to share everything about yourself on The Internet.

I've been programming for nearly twenty years but if you look at the quality of my code it looks more like two or three weeks at most. I hack things together until it works and when it inevitably breaks I burn it to the ground and start again from scratch. I call this terrible approach "write-only programming".

I pay nearly $75 a year for a vanity URL for my file uploads: [kimiga.aishitei.ru][1] and I use a Neocities to host my [personal website][2] which I have historically updated very sparingly.
